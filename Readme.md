# Custom React
This is a  project  which demonstrates working of reactjs with recursion 

## How it works

Firstly we have to give a object describes properties like tagname,styling,children,parent etc, to describe about any tag like in Reactjs.

then it takes an object and perform recussion on it and insert the element in root element

## Limitation

This only works for inherited elements but not for sibling elements
